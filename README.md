# fe-casualty-run-manager
Mini-project I decided to work on to practice coding. It helps manage a Casualty Run in Fire Emblem. Currently only supports FE8 but I might add other games in the future.

# Usage
This program requires Python 3 and PyQt5 to be installed.

To run the program, open your terminal and navigate to the folder where this program was downloaded to. Type the command
```python CRManager.py```
and press enter.
